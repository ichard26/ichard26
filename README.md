### Hey, nice to see you!

Hello! Iâ€™m Richard. I go by `ichard26` on the internet. My pronouns are he/they.

You may know me if you frequent the Python code quality space as I used to co-maintain your friendly code formatter,
[Black]! I also (kinda) co-maintained [bandersnatch]. Currently, I'm on the [mypyc] core team and Iâ€™m also staff on
the [Python Discord server][pydis].

Iâ€™m a hobby Python developer and OSS contributor, but I dabble in C and front-end web development from time to time.
Project-wise, tooling and language dev projects are my favourite. When Iâ€™m not doing development work, I like to take
photographs, go for walks .. or both at the same time! ðŸ“·

Anyway, I hope that you're having a good day :)
