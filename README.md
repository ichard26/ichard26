### Hey, nice to see you!

Hello! Iâ€™m Richard. I go by `ichard26` on the internet. My pronouns are he/they.

Iâ€™m a hobby Python developer and OSS contributor. Over the years, I've served on the core team
for several projects:

- **[pip]**: the Python package installer 
- **[mypyc]**: a Python-to-C transcompiler for typed code, built on top of mypy
- **[black]**: your friendly code formatter for Python, known for its _uncomprising_ code style
- **[bandersnatch]**: a simple mirror tool to generate a PEP 503 compliant index

I also serve as a moderator of the [Python Discord][pydis] community.

From time to time, I dabble in C and front-end web development. When Iâ€™m not doing development work,
I like to take photographs, go for walks .. or both at the same time! ðŸ“·

Anyhow, I hope that you're having a good day :)
