### Heya you've found a flower lover!

Hello, I'm Richard aka "ichard26", "daylily richard", "daylily", "richard âœ¿" or various other (probably
flower related) names as I switch it up way too much ðŸ™‚ Pronouns are he/they.

You might know me if you frequent the Python formatter/linter space as I co-maintain the incredibly popular
[psf/black](https://github.com/psf/black) project. I also co-maintain [pypa/bandersnatch](https://github.com/pypa/bandersnatch).
My main area of focus is usually maintainance and devops work so developer experience, CI, issue triage, and
PR review are my main duties -- although I'm a documentation nerd as well. Personal projects including
[diff-shades](https://github.com/ichard26/diff-shades), [next-pr-number](https://github.com/ichard26/next-pr-number),
and [blackbench](https://github.com/ichard26/blackbench) are unsurprisingly for the aforementioned projects!

I'm mostly a Python developer although I have ventured a little bit into JS/TS and C. My projects are typically
of the tooling (just look above) or language dev nature (I have this unreasonable persisent desire to write parsers).
When I'm not doing development work, I like to take photographs, go for walks .. or both at the same time ðŸ“·

**Fun fact:** I'm staff on the [Python Discord server](https://discord.gg/python) so feel free to chat with me on there!

Anyhow, have a wonderful day!
