### Hey, nice to see you!

Hello! Iâ€™m Richard. I go by `ichard26` on the internet. My pronouns are he/they.

> **Side-note:** I do like flowers, so my username/nick may be flower related from time to time.

You may know me if you frequent the Python code quality space as I co-maintain your friendly code formatter, [Black]!
I also co-maintain [bandersnatch]. As maintainer, I like to focus on maintenance, documentation, and PR review. On top
of that, Iâ€™m also staff on the [Python Discord server][pydis].

Iâ€™m a hobby Python developer and OSS contributor, but I dabble in C and front-end web development from time to time.
Project-wise, tooling and language dev projects are my favourite. When Iâ€™m not doing development work, I like to take
photographs, go for walks .. or both at the same time! ðŸ“·

Anyway, I hope that you're having a good day :)
